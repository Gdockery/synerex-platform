# Synerex Utility & Regulator Assurance Whitepaper

## Executive Summary
Synerex provides a utility‑grade EM&V and tracking platform designed to
produce defensible, auditable, and tamper‑evident energy performance data.

## Key Assurances
- Cryptographically signed baselines
- Immutable evidence snapshots
- Full audit trail of all actions
- Read‑only utility access
- Clear chain‑of‑custody from baseline to tracking

## EM&V Baseline Integrity
Baselines are sealed using cryptographic signatures and stored as immutable
snapshots. Each snapshot includes hashes of raw data and calculation inputs.

## Continuous Tracking Integrity
Tracking licenses are only issued when tied to a valid Synerex baseline,
ensuring provenance and methodological consistency.

## Audit & Oversight
Utilities may access:
- Signed baseline seals
- Evidence ZIP packages
- Audit logs (read‑only)

## Regulatory Alignment
The Synerex system supports:
- Measurement & Verification best practices
- Evidentiary standards suitable for disputes
- Transparent verification without disclosure of proprietary algorithms

## Conclusion
Synerex provides a higher standard of trust and defensibility than traditional
energy monitoring solutions.
