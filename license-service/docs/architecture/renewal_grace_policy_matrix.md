# Renewal + Grace Policy Matrix (Recommended)

This matrix defines renewal timing, grace windows, and suspension behavior for EM&V and Tracking licenses.

## Key principles
- License term is fixed; renewals issue a new license term.
- EM&V can support limited offline operation; Tracking is online-first with short verification cache TTL.
- Non-payment results in suspension after notice/cure (commercial terms) and/or automated overdue detection.
