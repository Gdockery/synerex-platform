# License as Access Authorization Clause (Synerex EM&V and Tracking)

The following language is intended to be inserted into the software-only license agreement(s)
for the Synerex One EM&V Program and the Synerex Tracking Program.

## Section: License as Access Authorization

1. **License Is Authorization.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that each Synerex software
license issued by Licensor (a “License”) constitutes the sole and exclusive authorization
for Licensee and its Authorized Users to access and use the corresponding cloud-hosted
Synerex program identified in the License (“Program”).

2. **Cloud Access Conditioned on Valid License.** Access to the Program is conditional upon
presentation of a valid, unexpired, and non-revoked License and successful verification by
Licensor’s license verification service. Licensor may deny or suspend access if the License
is invalid, expired, revoked, or otherwise not in compliance with this Agreement.

3. **Scope of Access Defined by License Claims.** The License defines the authorized scope of
use, including without limitation: (a) Program (EM&V or Tracking), (b) plan/tier, (c) roles,
(d) feature entitlements, (e) limits (including seat and meter limits), and (f) any baseline
lineage requirements for Tracking. Licensee shall not access or use any functionality outside
the scope granted by the License.

4. **No Separate Right of Access.** No account, credential, purchase order, statement of work,
invoice, or other instrument shall grant any right of access to the Program absent a valid
License. Any access provided without a valid License is unauthorized.

5. **License Controls Over Conflicting Terms.** In the event of a conflict between this Agreement
and the License claims regarding scope (plan, roles, features, limits), the more restrictive
control shall apply, and Licensor may update or reissue the License to reflect the Parties’
commercial terms.

6. **Auditability.** Licensee acknowledges that Program access, downloads of derivative artifacts,
and other governed actions may be logged by Licensor for security, audit, compliance, and
enforcement purposes, including evidentiary support for utility and regulatory reviews.
