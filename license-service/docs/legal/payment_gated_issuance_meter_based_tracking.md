# Payment-Gated License Issuance & Meter-Based Tracking Fees (Insert Language)

## Section: Payment-Gated Issuance and Activation
1. **Payment as Condition Precedent.** Licensee acknowledges that Licensor’s issuance and/or activation of any License is conditioned upon (a) receipt of payment in full, or (b) written credit approval permitting invoiced payment pursuant to the Parties’ commercial terms. Until such condition is satisfied, any License shall be deemed **pending payment** and shall not authorize access to the Program.

2. **Activation Upon Payment.** Upon satisfaction of the payment condition precedent, Licensor will issue and/or activate the applicable License through Licensor’s license management and verification service. Licensee’s access to the cloud-hosted Program is permitted only while the License remains valid, unexpired, non-revoked, and not suspended.

3. **Non-Payment Suspension.** If any undisputed amounts become past due, Licensor may suspend the License (and corresponding Program access) after any applicable notice and cure period set forth in this Agreement. During suspension, verification shall fail and Licensee shall have no right to access or use the Program.

## Section: Tracking Program Fees Based on Installed Meters
1. **Meter-Based Fees.** For the Synerex Tracking Program, fees are based on the number of installed and/or monitored meters covered by the License (“Licensed Meters”). Licensed Meters may be identified by meter identifiers and/or by a maximum meter limit specified in the License.

2. **True-Up and Changes.** If the number of Licensed Meters increases above the licensed meter limit (or above the paid-for meter count), Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor and pay the applicable incremental fees. Licensor may require a license update reflecting the revised meter count and may suspend Tracking access if Licensee exceeds the licensed meter count without payment.

3. **Audit Rights.** Licensor may audit Licensee’s meter counts and monitoring scope on reasonable notice to confirm compliance with meter-based fees and license limits. Any underpayment shall be promptly paid, together with applicable late charges if permitted by law.

## Section: Order and Invoice Controls
1. **Orders and Invoices.** Licensor may issue order confirmations and invoices that specify program, plan, term, and metered quantities (seats and/or meters). The License Service is the authoritative system of record for license term, scope, and limits.

2. **Controls Over Conflicts.** In the event of a conflict between an invoice and the License scope/limits, the more restrictive control shall apply unless and until Licensor issues an updated License reflecting the Parties’ agreed commercial terms.
