# Enhanced PDF Generation Service Dependencies
# Core PDF generation
reportlab>=4.0.0

# Additional dependencies for PDF generation
# Updated for Python 3.13 compatibility
Pillow>=10.0.0
lxml>=6.0.0

# Note: svglib removed as it requires rlpycairo/pycairo which needs Cairo system libraries
# SVG conversion can be handled by reportlab directly or omitted if not critical
# This ensures no system library dependencies are required
